# Project Name
The Survey
## Theme
You are pressing buttons for answering a survey.

## Game Play
Objective
Click the begin button
Click yes or no for what the survey asks you

## What did you 
I noticed I had to do avatar masking to make 2 animations play on one model so I created two models instead of spending more hours learning how to do it.

## Implementation
https://www.soundtrap.com was used for the audios.
Built using Unity 2022.3.45f
Other assets except the materials were created by the developer.

## Special Focus
My special focus is with modeling and animation so I spent the majority of my time modeling the interior and animating the scene of the monster walking in.
(I will agree or disagree with this sentiment, but I want to know what you thought)
